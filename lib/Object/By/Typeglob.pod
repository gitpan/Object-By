=head1 NAME

Object::By::Typeglob - minimalistic constructors for typeglob based objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	package some_package;
	use parent qw(Object::By::Typeglob);

	sub _constructor {
		my ($this, ...) = @_;
		...
		return;
	}

	package main;
	use some_package;
	some_package->constructor(...);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object::By::Typeglob provides generic constructors for OO programming, which are tailored to an actual class via a method called _constructor. A generic constructor creates a Symbol::geniosym reference from various sources, blesses, tailors, locks, and finally returns it.

=head1 METHOD REFERENCE (API)

The design goal was a simple and robust API with a straightforward implementation, respecting all limitations of Perl 5.

=item $class->constructor or class->constructor

A generic constructor for objects of the class. If the method _constructor is defined, calls _constructor and forwards any arguments to it.

=item $class->prototype_constructor or class->prototype_constructor

Prototype means, the object only carries a class and a new Symbol::geniosym.

=item $old_object->sibling_constructor

Takes the class of $old_object to create an object of the same class. Otherwise works like class->constructor.

For a way to use partial class names for object construction, see wild_construct from Package::Aspect::Wild_Class.
